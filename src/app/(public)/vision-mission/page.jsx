              Markham College of Commerce, Hazaribagh, was established on
              February 10, 1974, under the visionary leadership of B. D.
              Jaiswal. Named after the esteemed educationist Arthur Francis
              Markham, the college&apos;s founding principles were rooted in
              making higher education accessible to the region&apos;s aspiring
              minds.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Dr. Maheshwar Tiwari, alongside a dedicated team of educators
              including Prof. Shashi Kishore Narayan, Prof. Heyat Ahmed, and
              others, embarked on a journey to offer Intermediate Arts and
              Commerce programs. This marked the inception of a lifelong
              commitment to providing quality education to the community.
